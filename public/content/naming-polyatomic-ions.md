# Naming Conventions in Chemistry

As you may know, there are different types of ions. Some of them are monoatomic, which means that they consist of only one atom. Remember, an ion is an atom that has a net electric charge. Other types of ions, however, are polyatomic, which means that they consist of two or more atoms. These polyatomic ions carry a net electric charge as a group, and this is the type of ion that we'll talk about in this video.

Specifically, we'll talk about the naming rules for polyatomic ions, because there are certain conventions for this. If you're interested in learning more about the difference between monoatomic and polyatomic ions, or about naming rules for monoatomic ions specifically, we have separate articles about these topics. For now, let's focus on the naming rules for polyatomic ions.

The naming rules for polyatomic ions differ for anions and cations. In other words, they are different for positively charged polyatomic ions, so for cations, and negatively charged polyatomic ions, so for anions. A net positive charge in polyatomic ions occurs because the number of protons, which are positively charged, is larger than the number of electrons, which are negatively charged. Hence in this case, we have a cation. A net negative charge, on the other hand, occurs when the number of electrons is larger than the number of protons. In that case, we have an anion.

Let's start with the naming rules for polyatomic cations. There are two conventions for naming in this case.

# Naming Rules for Polyatomic Cations

The first is actually the least satisfying one because it is not very specific. This rule is that many polyatomic cations often simply do not have specific names that follow a strict naming convention. The naming in this case, is primarily based on common names which are unique and widely recognized in the field of chemistry. The names of these cations are often derived from their chemical composition or historical usage, and they are simply accepted as common names in the field of chemistry.

The most well-known polyatomic cation is **ammonium (NH₄⁺)**. Another example is **hydronium (H₃O⁺)**.

So this is the first naming convention for polyatomic cations, which is that in many cases naming is based on common names. However, there is one particular group of elements for which the polyatomic cations do have specific naming rules, and this is the group of transition metals.

## Transition Metals

So if you look at the periodic table of the elements, you'll see in the central block that there is a group of elements that is called the transition metals, and they include for example iron, copper, and gold.

![](/images/004%20Naming%20Polyatomic%20Ions/Nomenclature%20rules%20for%20anions%20and%20cations.jpg)

What is crucial to grasp is that transition metals are distinct from other elements in a way that is significant for our topic. Namely, they possess the capability to display multiple oxidation states. In simpler terms, this means that they can lose varying amounts of electrons. In contrast, elements that are not transition metals do not have this flexibility. They can only lose a specific number of electrons.

To briefly illustrate this, let's take the case of two monoatomic ions that are not transition metals, namely, potassium and magnesium. Potassium can only lose one electron, forming a potassium ion (K⁺), while magnesium, which isn't a transition metal either, can only lose two electrons, resulting in a magnesium ion (Mg²⁺).

On the other hand, when we consider a transition metal like copper, we observe that it can lose different quantities of electrons. For copper, the most prevalent oxidation states occur when it loses either one or two electrons. Therefore, **Cu⁺** and **Cu²⁺** represent the two main oxidation states of copper.

So, what implications does this have for answering our initial question, namely what does this mean for the naming rules for polyatomic cations in this context? For cations derived from transition metals that can have multiple oxidation states, we use Roman numerals to indicate the oxidation state.

**Example:** 
  - **Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO₄)** indicates that iron has a +2 oxidation state.
  - **Iron(III) sulfate (Fe₂(SO₄)₃)** indicates that iron has a +3 oxidation state.

In these examples, the Roman numeral in parentheses tells you the charge of the iron ion in the compound. So, this is the second convention for naming polyatomic cations, which is to use Roman numerals in the case of transition metals.

# Summary of Naming Rules for Polyatomic Cations

Let's summarize the naming rules for polyatomic cations:

- The first is to use specific names for common polyatomic cations, for example ammonium.
- And the second is to use Roman numerals for transition metals to indicate their oxidation states.

These two conventions sum up the naming rules for polyatomic cations.
Next, let's look at the naming rules for polyatomic anions.

# Naming Rules for Polyatomic Anions

So, polyatomic anions are groups of at least two atoms that, as a group, have a net negative charge. Like in the case of polyatomic cations, there are also conventions for how to name polyatomic anions.

## Suffixes "-ate" and "-ite"

The first convention and one of the most common ways to name polyatomic anions is by using the suffixes **"-ate"** and **"-ite"**. These suffixes indicate the number of oxygen atoms present in the ion.

Let's look at this a little bit more closely. Many polyatomic anions are part of a series, or a group of related anions that share a common element, and so in that sense they are similar. What makes them different from each other, is that they contain different numbers of oxygen atoms. In other words, they contain the same central atom, which is usually a non-metal, but they vary in the number of oxygen atoms attached to it. So one anion may have more oxygen atoms that another, leading to different chemical properties. Now, this has consequences for how the polyatomic anion is named.

Specifically, chemists use both suffixes and prefixes to distinguish between different polyatomic anions in the same series.

First, let's take a look at the suffixes that chemists use for this. The specific suffixes that they use are **"-ate"** and **"-ite"**. And the rule here is that the polyatomic anion that has more oxygen atoms get the suffix "-ate", whereas the anion with fewer oxygen atoms gets the suffix "-ite".

As an example, consider nitrate and nitrite. **Nitrate (NO₃⁻)** has one nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms. **Nitrite (NO₂⁻)** also has one nitrogen atom but two oxygen atoms. So, between these two we see that the ion that has more oxygen atoms, namely NO₃⁻, gets the suffix "-ate". And the one that has fewer oxygen atoms, namely NO₂⁻, gets the suffix "-ite".

So this is how chemists use suffixes to distinguish between different polyatomic anions in the same series, namely by assigning the suffix "-ate" to the ion that has more oxygen atoms and assigning the suffix "-ite" to the ion that has fewer oxygen atoms.

## Prefixes "hypo-" and "per-"

Now, in addition to the -ate and -ite suffixes, chemists use a second way to distinguish between different polyatomic ions in the same series. Namely, not only do they use the suffixes "-ate" and "-ite", but they also use prefixes. These prefixes are **"hypo-"** and **"per-"**.

The prefix "hypo-" means "less than." It is used for the ion with one fewer oxygen atom than the "-ite" form.
For example, **hypochlorite (ClO⁻)** has one oxygen atom, which is one fewer than **chlorite (ClO₂⁻)**, so the former gets the prefix "hypo-."

![](/images/004%20Naming%20Polyatomic%20Ions/Prefixes%20and%20suffixes%20are%20common%20in%20chemistry.jpg)

In contrast, the prefix "per-" means "more than." It is used for the ion with one more oxygen atom than the "-ate" form.
For example, **perchlorate (ClO₄⁻)** has one more oxygen atom than chlorate (ClO₃⁻), thus the former gets the prefix "per-."

So this is the second convention for naming polyatomic anions, namely that we assign the prefix **"hypo-"** to the ion that has one fewer oxygen atom than the "-ite" form, and we assign the prefix **"per-"** to the ion that has one more oxygen atom than the "-ate" form.

## 3. Unique Names

Now besides the naming rules for polyatomic anions that involve using the suffixes "-ite" and "-ate" and the prefixes "hypo-" and "per-", there is one more naming rule for polyatomic anions. This third rule is that some polyatomic anions have unique names.

Some examples are **hydroxide (OH⁻)**, which is a common polyatomic anion, and **cyanide (CN⁻)**, which is another polyatomic anion, often discussed for its toxicity.

### Summary of Naming Rules for Polyatomic Anions

So this brings us to a summary of the naming rules for polyatomic anions.

First, use **"-ate"** for the ion with more oxygen atoms, and use **"-ite"** for the ion with fewer oxygen atoms.
Second, use **"hypo-"** for the ion that has one fewer oxygen atom than the "-ite" form, and use **"per-"** for the ion that has one more oxygen atom than the "-ate" form.
And third and final, some polyatomic anions have unique names, for example hydroxide or cyanide.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we've covered a lot of ground. We've discussed the naming rules for polyatomic cations and for polyatomic anions. Let's recap what we've learned one more time.

For polyatomic cations, we have two rules for naming them:
- The first is to use specific names for common polyatomic cations, for example ammonium.
- And the second is to use Roman numerals for transition metals to indicate their oxidation states.

And for polyatomic anions, we have three rules for naming them:
- First, we use "-ate" for the ion with more oxygen atoms, and we use "-ite" for the ion with fewer oxygen atoms.
- Second, we use "hypo-" for the ion that has one fewer oxygen atom than the "-ite" form, and we use "per-" for the ion that has one more oxygen atom than the "-ate" form.
- And third and final, some polyatomic anions have unique names, for example hydroxide or cyanide.

So there you have it! These are the naming rules for polyatomic ions of both types, cations and anions.
