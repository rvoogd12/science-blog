## Different Types of Ions

So, as you likely know, there are different types of ions. In this article, we'll discuss one particular type of ion, namely monatomic ions, and specifically what the naming rules for this type of ion are.

Monatomic ions are ions that consist of one atom. This is different from another type of ion called polyatomic ions which are made up of two or more atoms. If you would like to know more about the difference between monatomic and polyatomic ions or about the naming rules for polyatomic ions, we have separate articles about these topics.

Now, for this article, we will focus specifically on the question of how monatomic ions are named, because there are specific rules for how this naming is done.

So the specific rules for how monatomic ions are named depend on whether the ion is a cation, so a positively charged ion, or an anion, so a negatively charged ion.

## Naming Rules for Monatomic Cations

For monatomic cations, the name of the ion is the same as the name of the element. So there is no difference between the name of monatomic cation and the name of the element.

For example, a sodium ion (Na⁺) is a monatomic cation, and it is named sodium, just like the element sodium.
As another example, a calcium ion (Ca²⁺) is also a monatomic cation, and it is named calcium, just like the element calcium.

So, the naming rules for monatomic cations are pretty straightforward, because the name of a monatomic cation is identical to the name of the element. This is true across the board, but there is one important exception to this rule.

This exception applies to one particular group of elements where the naming rules are a bit different, and this is the group of elements called transition metals.

### Transition Metals

As you might recall, there is a group of elements in the central block of the periodic table of elements that is called transition metals, and they include for example iron, copper, and gold.

What is important to understand, is that transition metals differ from other elements in a way that's important for our purpose, namely, they have the ability to exhibit multiple oxidation states.

What that means in simple terms, is that they can lose different numbers of electrons. For other elements that are not transition metals, this is not the case. These elements can only lose one specific number of electrons.

For example, sodium can only lose one electron resulting in a sodium ion (Na⁺), and calcium can only lose two electrons, resulting in a calcium ion (Ca²⁺).

However, when we take a transition metal such as iron, we see that it can lose different numbers of electrons. For iron, the most common oxidation states result when it loses two or three electrons. So Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ are the two primary oxidation states of iron.

So what does this mean for the answer to our original question, namely, what are the naming rules in this case?
If we have two oxidation states of iron, Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺, we can't really name both simply an iron ion, like we would with other monatomic ions, because then we don't know which of the two oxidation states we are referring to: Fe²⁺ or Fe³⁺.

So, how have chemists solved this issue? Well, they've come up with a rule for this, which is to include Roman numerals in parentheses to the name of the element.
In the case of iron, Fe²⁺ is named iron(II), and Fe³⁺ is named iron(III). And this solves our issue because the Roman numerals in parentheses make it possible for us to differentiate between the different oxidation states of transition metals.

So this is how we name monatomic ions from the group of transition metals.

So to quickly recap what we've talked about up until this point: We've looked into the naming rules for monatomic ions, and specifically for monatomic cations, which are positively charged ions. Now let's look at the naming rules for monatomic anions, so negatively charged ions.

## Naming Rules for Monatomic Anions

For monatomic anions, the name of the ion is derived from the name of the element, but the ending of the name is changed to "-ide."

For example, chlorine (Cl) becomes chloride (Cl⁻), oxygen (O) becomes oxide (O²⁻), and nitrogen (N) becomes nitride (N³⁻).
Note that we don't just add "-ide" to the element's name, because then chlorine for example would become "chlorineide", and that is not the case. So instead, we take the root of the element's name, which in the case of chlorine is "chlor-" and we add "-ide" and this leads us to the name of the monatomic anion which is in this case chloride. 

Although this naming rule is fairly straightforward, for some elements, things are a little bit less straightforward than for others.
For example, the monatomic anion of iron, is not called "ironide" or "iride" but instead it is called "ferride." This is because the Latin word for iron is "ferrum."
It is common in chemistry that the names of elements are based on Latin or Greek. You can see this also in other examples, for example copper comes from the Latin word "cuprum," so the monatomic anion is named "cupride." And lead comes from the Latin word "plumbum," so the monatomic anion is called "plumbide".

So you have to go back to the original names of the elements to be able to derive the name of the anion.

Now, different than for monatomic cations, where we have an exception to the general naming rule, namely for transition metals, the naming rule for monatomic anions applies across the board. In other words, the rule that monatomic anions are named by changing the ending of the element's name to "-ide" applies universally to all monatomic anions, with no exceptions, not even for monatomic anions from the transition metals group.

## Conclusion

So to recap the naming rules for monatomic ions, let's look at a brief summary of what we've learned so far:
1. **Monatomic cations** are named after the element, for example sodium or calcium, or with a Roman numeral for transition metals, for example iron(II) or copper(II).
2. **Monatomic anions**, on the other hand, are named by taking the root of the element's name and adding the suffix "-ide", for example chloride, oxide, or nitride.
